schizzors_ecs
=========
A overhaul of an old project called [schizzors](https://gitlab.com/godwhoa/schizzors) this one uses an Entity Component System for greater flexiblity

### Game idea
```
Players gets three forms: rock, paper and scissors.
Players can 
         shape-shift between those forms.
         move around and shoot.
Logic for who wins when shot is borrowed from rock-paper-scissors.
So, if rock shot scissors rock wins.
```
### TODO

+ Fix all import errors
